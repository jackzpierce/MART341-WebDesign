The goal of my website is to replicate the website of a yoga school that is offering a teacher training. I will be using images from the teacher training that I attended, so I will be able to imagine myself as the user easily.

Responsive web design is important because a website needs to be easy to use in order to be effective. The website should be visually interesting, and aesthetically pleasing to encourage the user to stay on the site, and easy to navigate so that they don't get frustrated and waste time trying to find what they are looking for.
