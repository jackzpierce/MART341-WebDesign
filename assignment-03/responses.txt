1) An IP address is a unique string of numbers corresponding to a computer or server. A DNS (domain name system) translates these numbers into alphabetical form. This makes it easier to access a website, For example, google.com, rather than a string of numbers.

2) Cookies are text files that contain small pieces of data used to identify your computer on a network. These files can be used to remember your username, passwords, or preferences on a given site. They can also help you identify which links you have already clicked on a website (purple vs. blue text.)

3) The three essential parts of a URL are the protocol, the domain name, and the path.

The protocol dictates how the server communicates with the browser, for example, HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol.)

The domain name is the alphabetical address of a website, a unique name that provides directions to a specific site.

Paths are directions to the directories and subdirectories of a website. Paths lead to the files that the page you are viewing consists of in your browser.
