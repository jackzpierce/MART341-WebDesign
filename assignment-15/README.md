My testing sessions went well. To be fair, I tested the website quite a bit myself first, because I wanted to make sure all the links worked before I tested it.

One change I am considering making is combining the "Apply" and "Contact" page into one to avoid redundancies. I am still unsure though because they each serve a unique purpose on their own.

I am also thinking about tweaking the color palette to make the site even more dynamic.

The challenge I faced this week was combining different HTML and CSS elements we have learned so far into a brand-new site. I looked over websites from past assignments, and figured out the code I would need to incorporate to bring my current vision to fruition.

I did a bit of trial and error for my second draft and tweaking with graphics and color palettes. My site still needs some fine-tuning, but I am super happy with the layout, navigation, and content I created.
